Sorry, I goofed on the time. I thought it was due Saturday at 10, not 9. I at least wanted to get you the review in.

What was your favorite topic or project in the course and why? (1pt)

All of the material was very enjoyable and fun. Very much engaging. Even the grittier bits had some great backing and reasoning to learn them.

 If you could improve any aspect of this course, what would it be and why? (1pt)

Some more hands on coding examples would be good. And some more maps to how graphics concepts all connect together. I know you had your outline for the course, but something more visual could be very helpful.

Also, provide some baseline files for the final. This was rather confusing after having files given throughout the course. Then only to be given some images.
